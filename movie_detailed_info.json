The film maker chased it for over two years to capture the magical interaction between the soft mist, the ridges of the California coast and the iconic Golden Gate Bridge. The film showcases a unique way of looking at the movement of fog, which is usually hidden in time. Simon Christen lifts us above that thick cold blanket to reveal a beautiful ocean that crests, flows and ebbs. Only the highest points of the city and it's bridges can peek through, becoming adrift, while the rest is caressed by this natural beauty.",

But when Yasaburo comes to the aid of a woman he believes to be a prostitute, he soon learns that there are more kinds of weapons than he'd ever imagined... For the woman is actually Rin, a female ninja enforcer assigned to pose as a prostitute in order to investigate shipments of an illegal aphrodisiac, and the deadliest weapon in ancient Japan isn't made of steel or wood, but rather of human flesh in the form of a deadly kunoichi assassin. Get ready for the wildest eroninja film ever as three of Japan's hottest female stars - Akiho Yoshizawa, Asami and Rin Kawaii - bring Junichi Yagami's epic erotic novels of sex and steel to life in Sultry Assassin: The Aphrodisiac Kill!",
